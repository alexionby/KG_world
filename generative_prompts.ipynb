    "I want you to create unreal and unique names for imaginary companies. I can give you example from real world: `NVIDIA Corporation, pepsico Inc., exxon mobil corporation, yandex LLC, Toyota Motor Corporation` there are short names with no similarity to real english words. I mean these words doesn't exist in language. That is what i want, unique names of 1 to 3 words plus business descriptor from this list: `[\"Inc.\", \"Corp.\", \"LLC\", \"Ltd.\", \"Co.\", \"PLC\", \"GmbH\", \"AG\", \"S.A.\", \"Pty. Ltd.\", \"L.P.\"]` and also you can add additional word that specify company's direction, with 50% possibility, for example: `\"Systems\", \"Solutions\", \"Technologies\", \"Services\"` and so on. Provide results as list of Python dictionaries, with fields `off` and `alt`, where `off` stands for full name and `alt` for short, like `pepsi`, `nividia`, `toyota` etc. I want at least 30 names."

    "Generate names for humans. Those names should be unreal and looks different from real names that we used to. I need name and surname for each person. Names could be repeating, surnames must stay unique. Also for every name generate unique identifier of 10 symbols. The identifiers are a combination of two letters of name, a 5 random digits and the three letters of surname. Letters from`id` are in upper case. Provide generations as json with fields `name` and`id` for 40 imaginary persons. Dont use newline before and after brackets:`{`, `}`. "
